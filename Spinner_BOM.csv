ESP Memory thoughts:  Spoke = 25 LEDs, 3 Bytes / LED, 360 Spokes --> 3*25*360 = 27k
So.. most have 512KB of sram... and the N8R2 has 2MB psramf

OLD, no longer usingf -->  ESP32 Module:  ESP32-WROVER-E-N16R8, C529589


New thoughts on parts:

Through Beam: ZGY8402(ITR), C277757, Package: DIP-4
    New decission:  Use the same 3 through beam sensors.  The absolute encoder will be mounted somewhere not on the board.
                    Probably mounted a centimeter above the board close to a battery.
ESP32 Module:  ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R2,  C2913204
    FIX THIS:  The package we have in kicad is the -1U which has a SMA instead of a trace antenna with keep out.    
USB-C:  C5150972, 12402012E212A  
    FTDI is used for programming - Is this still true??  We can program the esp32-S3 over USB... but always?  does it require a bootloader?   
    Answer:   ESP32-S3 has a ROM bootloader as permanent fallback / backup.  USB will enumerate as a serial port.  So... no FTDI type thing.
SD HOLDER: TF-CARD H1.8,  C7529389
BMS: BQ24073RGTR, C15220,  This handles 1.5A input charging, and 5A output (LEDs can draw, 75*20*3)
Boost:  fTPS61022RWUR, C915088, VQFN-7(2x2)
Inductor (boost):  XAL7030-102MEC, C19191626, SMD,7.5x7.5mm
Switch: JS102011SAQN, C221660
Reset Button: C720477, TS-1088-AR02016
Boot Button: C720477, TS-1088-AR02016

LDO:  C9055, SPX3819M5-L-3-3/TR, Package:  SOT-23-5

LEDs for power:  C84256 red 0805 and C2297 (green)



Battery is going to be a (AA li-ion), 14500 3.7v / battery


------- PINS -------------
SPI Notes:
SPI 0 & 1 are used by flash & psram.
SPI 2 is more fancy and should be used with the SD card interface.
SPI 3 should be used for the LEDs.
GPIO for SPI 2 & 3 can be muxed to any pin.

SPI2 is going to be used for SD card interface:
ESP32-S3 pin	SD card pin	Notes
GPIO9	CLK	10k pullup
GPIO10	CMD	10k pullup
GPIO11	D0	10k pullup
GPIO12	D1	not used in 1-line SD mode; 10k pullup in 4-line mode
GPIO13	D2	not used in 1-line SD mode; 10k pullup in 4-line mode
GPIO14	D3	not used in 1-line SD mode, but card's D3 pin must have a 10k pullup



----------- Micropython Test SD ---------------

Testing completed:  Determined that resistors are not needed.
