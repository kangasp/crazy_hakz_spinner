ESP Memory thoughts:  Spoke = 25 LEDs, 3 Bytes / LED, 360 Spokes --> 3*25*360 = 27k
So.. most have 512KB of sram... and the N8R2 has 2MB psram

OLD, no longer using -->  ESP32 Module:  ESP32-WROVER-E-N16R8, C529589


New thoughts on parts:
Bounce Beam:  DY-ITR20001/T24,  C7433015, Package:  DIP-4
Through Beam: ZGY8402(ITR), C277757, Package: DIP-4
ESP32 Module:  ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R2,  C2913204
    FIX THIS:  The package we have in kicad is the -1U which has a SMA instead of a trace antenna with keep out.    
USB-C: USB-TYPE-C-009, C2927029
    FTDI is used for programming
SD HOLDER: TF-CARD H1.8,  C7529389
BMS: BQ24073RGTR, C15220,  This handles 1.5A input charging, and 5A output (LEDs can draw, 75*20*3)



Battery is going to be a (AA li-ion), 14500 3.7v / battery
